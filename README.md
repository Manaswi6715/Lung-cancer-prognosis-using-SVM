Discription:
Predicting lung diseases using machine learning, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, involves leveraging various patient attributes to build a model that can accurately classify individuals into different disease categories. Attributes such as age, gender, air pollution exposure, alcohol and tobacco usage, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle factors like diet and obesity, among others, play crucial roles in understanding and predicting lung diseases. By analyzing these attributes, SVM aims to identify patterns and relationships that distinguish between healthy individuals and those at risk or diagnosed with chronic lung conditions.(Trained the model with acc:100%,Sensitivity: 100%, Specifictity: 100%) and the testing data was given as input from user.

Algorithms:
